#  Requirements and Installation

In order to use the spaceborne-emission calculator efficiently also on your platform we would reccommend the usage of the "Fast Cross-Platform Package Manager" [Mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba), which will handle all the necessary dependencies for the spaceborne-emmission calculator following the setup procedure described here from the scratch:

* Get the necessary python version and a packagemanager for handling virtual python environments, if you do not already have a tool for managing these environments. This is a an important step as we strongly advise you to not alter your operating systems own python environment as there is the potential to break dependencies and render other programs non functional when installing additional packages or changing your systems python version.</br>
We would like to reccommend to use the binary python _3.X_ installers if you start from scratch using these [Binaries](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge), which are available for most computing platforms. 


* After the installation process of the binaries you might need to close and reopen your terminal window.


* Create your new python environment with: [`mamba create -n py39spaceborne python=3.9`] </br>   
For the space-emissions tool you need to use Python>=3.9.</br>
Activate your new environment: [`conda activate py39spaceborne`] </br>
Install your dependencies: [`mamba install jupyterlab gdal geopandas shapely numpy rtree pyproj contextily pytest requests -c conda-forge`] </br>
The shorthand version would be: [`mamba create -n py39spaceborne python=3.9 jupyterlab gdal geopandas shapely numpy rtree pyproj contextily pytest requests`]


* Now you should be able to run the Jupyter notebooks from the spaceborne-emission calculator given that you have activated your new environment with [`conda activate py39spaceborne`] and you are seeing `py39spaceborne` in your shell before your command prompt. To start up Jupyter Notebook just type and execute [`jupyter-notebook`] in your shell.
